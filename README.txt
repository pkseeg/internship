This project was a collaborative mentored undergraduate research project under Dr. Gilbert Fellingham of
Brigham Young University completed in the 2018-2019 school year.

We had a team of 12 interns collecting data from BYU Men's and Women's tennis matches.
The data, combined with data which earlier researchers had gathered in years prior, were analyzed to attempt to measure clutch performance in tennis matches.
